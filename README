visualMarks is just a small vimScript allowing marking and retrieving visually
selected blocks by associating them to marks, in way inspired from Vim's native
"registers".

To use it, for example with mark `a`, type in visual mode:

    ma<cr>

This will save your selection to the mark `a`. To retrieve it later, just type
from normal mode:

    <a<cr>

And you will get it back. Of course, you can replace `a` with any mark you want.
They will not overwrite your regular registers.

A few more features will come soon I hope. Feel free to contribute of course if
you feel inspired! :)
